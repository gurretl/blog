### Talk 2: Reporting on Reliability - Improving stakeholder conversations
#### Summary
[Ramón Medrano Llamas](https://ch.linkedin.com/in/rmedranollamas) discusses best practices for communicating about reliability, especially during and after incidents. Reliability engineers have long practiced blameless retrospectives to learn from past incidents, but stakeholders outside of the operations team may not be so forgiving. 
#### Key takeaways
- **What the heck? - Incident status**
  - Use appropriate channels (avoid conference call, use chats and live docs)
  - Be predictable (regular updates)
  - Most people should mostly listen
- **What was that? - Postmortem**
  - Criticize systems, not people
  - Asumme that everyone is involved in an incident had good intentions
  - "Human" errors are systems problems
- **How it's going? - Periodic reliability reviews**

### Talk 6: DevOps - like Riding a Bike or rather like Playing Golf?
#### Summary
For some people, DevOps is daily routine, for others it is still new ground. In this talk, [Dr. Martin Wechsler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinwechsler/) talks about challenges of an IT organisation, and how Migros Group IT approaches DevOps.
#### Key takeaways
- How to tackle DevOps :
  - allow teams to progress with goals
  - learn how to do DevOps with your current situation (even if it's SAP)
- **DevOps is more like Golf than Bike**
  - Requires larger effort to learn
  - No progress without practice
  - Mental condition is important
  - Sometimes does not work, and you don't know why

Migros has adopted SAFe in its transformation. Devops culture "You build it, you run it" remain an essential leverage for Migros teams. There is no "Golden Path" or standard tools for teams, they're free to chose their own tools. Communities of practices are the channel to share their practices and tools, but no enforcement is done.

### Evening Event
<span style="display:block;text-align:center">![](/_images/002_beer.jpg)</span>

## Day 2

After a great first day and few beers, we're excited to dive into another day of insightful talks and engaging workshops. Last night's evening event provided a wonderful opportunity to connect with fellow professionals in the DevOps community, and we're looking forward to continuing those conversations throughout the day. Let's jump right in!

### Talk 1: Developer Productivity Engineering – The Next Big Thing in Software Development
#### Summary
In a keynote style talk, [Justin Reock](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinreock/), Field CTO and Chief Evangelist at Gradle, discussed why Developer Productivity Engineering (DPE) is important for software engineering. He explained how DPE uses acceleration technologies and data analytics to speed up the software build and test process, improve developer efficiencies, and achieve faster feedback cycles. Reock also provided an overview of the key concepts and tools of DPE, the business impact on key objectives, the business case for DPE, and the role of AI/ML in DPE moving forward.
#### Key takeaways
- Productivity is significant at organizations level (and not developer level contrary to the 10x Engineer myth)
- Productive organizations are more attractive and retain their engineering workforce
- Productvity is directly linked to developers joy at work: joy is brought by having engineers do creative work, and briging as fast as possible the feedback of their work
- DPE is an engineering approach to productivity
- 81% of IT professionals would agree that DPE's make their job more enjoyable
- Effects on productivity AND quality
- Faster builds improve the creative flow, llower builds favor context-switching
- Solution for faster builds :
  - The use of **build caches** (complementary to dependency cache) allow to avoid unnecessary rebuilding of the portions of the code which are not related and can't be impacted by the change. 
  - Using **tests distributions**, in order to maximize the parallelism of the test phase
  - Using ML for **predictive test selection**, an interesting technique (for pre merge) that use Machine Learning to discard the tests which won't be necessary to re-run based on the change that has been made
  - **Scanning builds** (even locally) will help to start understanding some of the bottlenecks and inefficiencies that could be addressed
  - Address **test flakyness** with the highest importance, which reduces dramatically the trust in tests and brings only frustration
  - Ensure **performance continuity**, make it a standard routine that keeps being evolved
  - Stop asking: "Is the build cycle fast enough ?" but rather "Is the cycle as fast as it can possibly be ?"

### Talk 2: Great Security is One Question Away
#### Summary
[Wiktoria Dalach](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinreock/) talked about the myths surrounding application security and how it is often perceived as difficult by developers. In her talk, she shared practical tips and the most useful pieces from the Application Security theory to make security less scary and not a boring topic.
#### Key takeaways
- Security concerns can be sorted in 3 categories (CIA)
  - Confidentiality
  - Integrity
  - Availability
- Ask yourself how the CIA can be break
- Discuss it with your team
- Make it part of your process
- Shift security left

### Talk 3: Development process of Cloud native applications - a story of transformation
#### Summary
[Thomas Stein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-stein83/) and [Timon Schuele](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timon-schuele-244901269/) present the cloud native journey of SAP Cloud ALM, a SaaS solution with over 2000 customers and 250 developers. They discuss the importance of asking the right questions when creating a new cloud product, having the right core beliefs to reach the Elite-Level of DORA, and the benefits of a paved road of tools to speed up cloud transformation. The talk aims to emphasize that the software development process should be viewed as a system rather than just the sum of individual tools and processes.
#### Key takeaways

The journey described by the presenters on how they moved from a legacy server-kind of deployment to regular delivery of applications. The biggest challenge, unsurprisingly, was changing the culture and having teams apply the famous devops mantra: "You build it, you run it". 

Main enablers for their transformation:
- Adopting a single trunk methodology (thus using an in-house feature toggles system & portal)
- Daily deployment to production by improving the automation
- Shift left principles for quality and security
- Paved road Deploy with confidence

    
### Talk 4: Effective Observability in Microservice Architectures

In this workshop, attendees gained a hands-on introduction to Backstage and learn about its core features, such as the software catalog, documentation as code system, and scaffolder, as well as its plugin architecture. The session also covered learnings from creating portals with clients, including technical issues and business benefits.
##### Key takeaways
- Great for large companies
- Backstage is a framework, not a product:
  - Needs effort to build
  - Needs effort to maintain

#### Workshop 3: Setup a branch specific pipeline
##### Summary
By [Marc Herren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-herren-7181b0ab/)- During this workshop, participants learned how to create a Gitlab CI pipeline from scratch and add a workflow to perform different steps on different branches. The goal was to create a fully functional pipeline that performs tests on merge requests, builds images on the main branch, scans images on the integration branch, and rolls out the image on the production branch. This will be accomplished by creating a version file of the frontend/backend image tag and reusing it in later stages.
